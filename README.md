Arguebot is a twitter bot that listens for @mentions, and then tweets a random reply back. Fill the `replies.txt` file with token antagonistic responses (a new response per line), set up your twitter access tokens, run the bot and kick back whilst arguebot does all the hard braincell killing work of arguing with Donald Trump fans for you.

## Installation

Clone the repo and then...

```
gem install twitter
gem install dotenv

ruby arguebot.rb
```
